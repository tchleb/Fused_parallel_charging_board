# Overview

I created last year this PCB for parallel charging LiPo / LiIo Batteries. My goal was too have a little bit of extra safety when i charge parallel. 

- XT60 / XT30 are fused with 15A fuses.
- Balancer fused with self resetable SMD fuses.

## Order PCB

I can recommend JLCPCB.com to order the PCB.
- 1.6mm thick PCB
- 5pcs / ~5â‚¬ incl. shipping to Europe

## Order Parts

I ordered the parts from LCSC.com. I have added the BOM, this can be imported directly into the LCSC.com BOM Tool.


## Safety

**Check the guidelines for parallel charging** and plug the **XT60/XT30** first
